# React Mining Semi-Idle Game
This is a project made by me of a web game based on clicker games like "Cookie Clicker".

The main goal of the project is to extend my programming knowledge while having fun. The main aspects of the game will be:

> * Implement a "Semi-Idle" scheme, where the player may be extremely rewarded by being active, while still being able to progress while idle.
> * Create dynamic changing pages with React, with objects changing states all the time.
> * Create a reusable and expandable code.
